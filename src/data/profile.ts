Currently working in an AI/ML role, I'm gaining hands-on experience applying data science techniques to real systems and learning how analytical work translates into meaningful outcomes. I enjoy understanding problems deeply, exploring data, and contributing to solutions that create tangible value.

With experience in customer engagement, team leadership and industry projects, I thrive in collaborative environments where I can continue to learn, grow and make a meaningful impact.`;

      "This end-to-end system transforms a library of static documents into an interactive, AI-powered search application. It functions as a specialized question-answering tool whose knowledge is strictly limited to the provided source documents, ensuring all responses are verifiable.\n\nThe Data Preparation phase is automated by a pipeline of custom scripts that store documents in a database, convert them into machine-readable text using AI-powered image analysis and OCR, then enrich metadata with AI-generated summaries, categories, authors, and keywords.\n\nThe User Application provides a web interface where users ask questions in natural language. An AI search service returns synthesized answers with clickable citations. For complex queries, a Deep Research mode automates multi-step analysis, generating follow-up questions and compiling findings into structured reports with executive summaries, key findings, and actionable insights.",
